A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate values. 

A set can be created by using the keyword  set  or by using curly braces  {} . 

However, to create an empty set you can only use the  set  construct, curly braces alone will create an empty
dictionary.

Set operations:
   Union - All items in both sets
   Intersection - Only items that appear in both sets
   Difference - The difference between two sets
   Symmetric difference - Items that dont appear in both sets
